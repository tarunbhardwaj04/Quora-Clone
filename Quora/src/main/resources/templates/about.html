    <h1>🚀 Quora Clone - Spring Boot Backend</h1>


    <p class="para">A robust, enterprise-grade REST API built using Spring Boot 3.5.x, designed to replicate the core
        functionalities of a Q&A platform like Quora. This project focuses on high performance, clear architectural
        separation, and reliable database versioning.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">🏛️ Architectural Overview</h2>
    <p class="para">The project follows a Layered Architecture to ensure clean code, maintainability, and easy testing:

        Controller Layer: Handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to service methods.

        Service Layer: Contains the core business logic, validations, and orchestration between different components.

        Repository Layer: Utilizes Spring Data JPA for efficient interaction with the MySQL database.

        Entity Layer: Defines the database schema using Java objects (User, Question, Answer, Topic).

        DTO (Data Transfer Object): Decouples the internal database structure from the API response to maintain security
        and flexibility.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">🛠️ Technology Stack</h2>
    <p class="para">Java 21: Leveraging the latest LTS features.

        Spring Boot 3.5.x: Core framework for auto-configuration and rapid development.

        MySQL: Relational database for persistent storage.

        Flyway: Professional database migration tool to manage schema versioning and history.

        Hibernate/JPA: ORM for seamless mapping between Java objects and SQL tables.

        Maven: Dependency management and build automation.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">🗄️ Database Management & Migration</h2>
    <p class="para">Unlike traditional projects that use ddl-auto=update, this project utilizes Flyway for database
        versioning.

        Version Control: All schema changes (tables, indexes, constraints) are tracked in
        src/main/resources/db/migration.

        Reliability: Hibernate is set to validate mode, ensuring the Java code and Database schema stay perfectly
        synchronized.

        Audit Trail: Flyway maintains a flyway_schema_history table to track which migrations have been applied.</p>

    <h2 class="subheading">🔑 Core Features</h2>
    <p class="para">User Profiles: Comprehensive user registration and bio management.

        Threaded Q&A: Users can post questions and provide multiple answers per question.

        Topic Categorization: Questions can be tagged with various topics for better discoverability.

        Relational Integrity: Strict use of Foreign Keys and constraints to ensure data consistency.</p>
